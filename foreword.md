- "If art interprets our dreams, the computer executes them in the guise
 of programs"
- Once a programs function can be specified in the predicate calculus,
the proof methods of logic can be used to deduce its correctness.
However, as programs get large this becomes extremely difficult to do.
- "Since large programs grow from small ones, it is crucial that we
develop an aresonal of standard program structures of whose correctness
we have become sure - we call them idioms - and learn to combine them
into larger structures using organizational techniques of proven value."
- "Think of it: the behavior of the smallest physical switching element
is modeled by quantum mechanics described by differential equations
whose detailed behavior is captured by numerical approximations
represented in computer programs executing on computers composed of
